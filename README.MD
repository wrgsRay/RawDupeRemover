 Scans a folder, look for raw files without corresponding and delete them 
 
 For example:
 
 You have a folder with 100 files. The folder contains sets of files such as:
 
-  A0001.JPG
-  A0001.ARW
-  A0002.JPG
-  A0002.ARW
-  A0003.ARW
-  A0004.ARW
 
 This program will scan for JPG and supported raw files(current ARW and CR2) and move the raw/jpg files without an accompanying raw/jpg to another folder.
